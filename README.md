# SpeedRelevatorSTM32Discover

In this project we use the microcontroller STM32 Discovery to relevate three different speed : idle, walk and run.

We founded data of walk, idle and run with our microcontroller and we start the program on MatLab where we found some fondumental parametres.

Finally we wrote the code C of the projects that run on the microcontroller and it detects the different speed. For each one a light of a different color lights up
